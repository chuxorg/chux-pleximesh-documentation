# PlexiMesh Documentation

Welcome to the PlexiMesh documentation hub. These pages describe the runtime architecture, governance model, and Sprint 1 execution references.

## Contents
- [PlexiMesh Runtime Documentation](runtime.md) — platform-grade overview of the runtime, core concepts, execution model, messaging, runners, governance, and philosophy.
- [Sprint 1 Execution Model](sprint-1-execution-model.md) — Guardian-governed sequence from sprint authorization to the first agent commit.
- [PlexiMesh & AWACS User Guide](user-pleximesh-awacs.md) — operator-focused explanation of PlexiMesh, AWACS, Canon, events, and governed execution workflows.

All documents published here mirror Canon artifacts. When in doubt, defer to the Canon sources stored in the repository root.
