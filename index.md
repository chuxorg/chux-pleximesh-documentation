# PlexiMesh Documentation Hub

This site hosts the canonical documentation bundles for PlexiMesh. The content is grouped by audience so readers can navigate directly to runtime references, operator guides, and execution records.

## Quick Navigation
- [Runtime Reference](docs/runtime.md) — technical overview of the runtime system, messaging contracts, runners, governance, and observability boundaries.
- [User & Operator Guide](docs/user-pleximesh-awacs.md) — how PlexiMesh and AWACS operate in practice, including Canon usage, execution steps, and common pitfalls.
- [Sprint 1 Execution Model](docs/sprint-1-execution-model.md) — Guardian-governed sequence from sprint authorization to the first Engineering Agent commit.

## Documentation Classes
| Audience | Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Engineers | [Runtime Reference](docs/runtime.md) | Deep dive into components, guarantees, and constraints. |
| Operators | [PlexiMesh & AWACS Guide](docs/user-pleximesh-awacs.md) | Explains day-to-day usage, workflows, and observability. |
| Governance | [Sprint 1 Execution Model](docs/sprint-1-execution-model.md) | Records the execution handshake enforced by Guardian. |

All pages link back to the Canon sources stored alongside the runtime repositories. When in doubt, consult the Canon artifacts referenced within each document.
